# Population-Growth

During the 20th century, the total world population has increased by 4-fold. The current world population as of 2019 is 7.6 billion, and is showing no signs of slowing down. Research has shown that the Earth as of right now can only provide enough resources for 10 billion people, so the rise in population is causing many population alarmists to worry about potential disasters stemming from too high demand for essential resources.  

Based on past data on population statistics, population growth can be predicted and explored upon using statistical models such as ARIMA. ARIMA is an acronym for â€œautoregressive integrated moving average", and is a model used in statistics and economics to predict future data in a series. In this statistical study, ARIMA will be used for population series predictions. 

Purely taking into account the world population since 1960, population alarmists seem to have a good point. Based on the current population trend, the world population would be projected to hit 14 billion by 2100, way over the maximum capacity Earth can sustain.

However, the projected growth fails to consider falling birth rates. As countries industrialize and get richer, birth rates tend to fall, as well as the percentage growth of the population. From 1951 to 2021, the percentage of growth in the world population has fallen from 1.88% to 1.05%. Based on this data, predictions can be made on the basis of the percentage change of the population, which show that growth will fall.

Taking into account predicted growth rates of the population rather than purely the amount of people on the planet, a more accurate world population prediction can be made.

The predictions show that the world population will cap at around 10.3 billion people, and begin to fall as people choose to have less children and older people begin dying. 

Population alarmists still warn that the world population cap is over 10 billion, and therefore we will run out of resources to sustain it. However, this fear is paved with a tunnel view of the world. As more people are born into better and better lives as a result of industrialization, those people begin inventing, manufacturing, distributing, and using new products that can increase the effiency of finding resources from Earth. Our current planet with our current inventions can sustain 10 billion people, but as more people invent, that population cap can be raised. 

Humans should be less worried about the growth of population and more worried into events that could harm the growth and well being of the population, such as poverty and climate change. Based on current population trends, the world will be able to sustain all human life assuming the problems hindering our growth are solved.
